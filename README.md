# shroomcore
this is a quite rudimentary app i made to learn a few precepts of tkinter and python, by using the mushroom api i made on a previous project. the app connects to the database and then parses the json to display either poisonous or deadly mushrooms. the images have some filters for a retro win95 app style.
